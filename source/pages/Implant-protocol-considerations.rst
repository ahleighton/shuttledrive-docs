                    <h3 id="warningprotocol."><span style="color: rgb(255,102,0);">This outline is a suggestion based on methods that we found to work well - all methods are subject to protocol approval at your institution. </span></h3>
                    <div class="methodblock">1) (Optionally) weigh the implant to document variations in the amount of epoxy used in constructing the drive.</div>
                    <div class="methodblock">2) Depending on the method used to connect the ground wire to the grounding site, verify that all connectors function properly. Some types of connectors such as mill-max pins have a lot of friction on first use.</div>
                    <div class="methodblock">3) Prior to implanting, electroplate the electrodes (see <a class="external-link" href="http://www.jove.com/video/1098/micro-drive-array-for-chronic-in-vivo-recording-tetrode-assembly" rel="nofollow">Nguyen et al. 2009</a> for protocol), and document the electrode impedances.</div>
                    <div class="methodblock">4) Make sure that all electrodes are at well defined depths at the time of implant, so that the electrode position can be precisely reconstructed later.</div>
                    <div class="methodblock">5) Fill the guide tubes with silicone or mineral oil to inhibit CSF or blood from entering the guide tubes. Take care not to coat any other part of the drive with oil in order to ensure proper cement attachment during the surgery. Repeat this step just before implanting the drive, so the guide tubes are filled all the way to the bottom.</div><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><figure><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" height="442" width="400" src="http://open-ephys.github.io/flexDrive/imgs/surgery_overview.png" data-image-src="http://open-ephys.github.io/flexDrive/imgs/surgery_overview.png" loading="lazy"><figcaption> Figure: Implanted flexDrive </figcaption></figure></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> </span></p>
                    <div class="methodblock">6) Perform the implant surgery according to your protocol and the guidelines of your institution. <strong>We find that performing complete <a href="durotomy.html" data-linked-resource-id="3211294" data-linked-resource-version="6" data-linked-resource-type="page">durotomies</a> minimizes brain deformation and yields better recordings at small electrode pitches.</strong></div>
                    <div class="methodblock">7) During surgery, fill the space between the guide tube array and the brain with mineral oil/paraffin according to the surgical protocol.</div>
                    <div class="methodblock">8) Attach the drive to the skull using dental cement, skull screws and/or adhesives according to your protocol. Make sure that no adhesive gets under the guide tube array.</div>
                    <div class="methodblock">9) During implantation, keeping the 2 corner tetrodes out by ~250um allows you to take pictures of these during insertion, to register the guide tube array to pictures taken after the craniotomy (containing scale bars). Electrodes can be lowered as soon as the animal has recovered from surgery. Delaying the onset of the lowering for more than ~5 days post surgery increases the risk that dura and bone regrowth interferes with the electrodes.
